It was a task (assignment) for Natural Language Processing Course (Spring 2020). 

The task was to implement an abusive language classi_er using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in Python 3.

The main modules to implement to achieve the goal of this assignment were

1) Data pre-processor to transform raw data into a format suitable for input to the model, 

2) Token encoder to represent each token with a vector of real numbers, 

3) RNN classifier to assign a label to each input sequence that shows whether it is offensive or not, 

4) Training function that performs forward and backward propagation, and 

5) Evaluation function that evaluates the performance of the model in every training epoch.


The sourcecode is given in code folder. hw2_4_prep.ipynb has code for preprocessing. Other 3 notebook has 3 models.
